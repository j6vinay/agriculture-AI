# AI-Powered Weed Detection Model on Vipas.AI

## Overview
Weed management is one of the most significant challenges in modern agriculture. Manual identification and removal of weeds are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. AI-powered weed detection models provide a scalable, automated approach to identifying and classifying weeds with high accuracy, enabling farmers to take targeted action and optimize crop yields.

This deep learning-based **Weed Detection Model**, built using **computer vision and deep neural networks**, classifies weed species with precision. Hosted on **Vipas.AI**, this model provides **real-time weed detection**, scalable deployment, and monetization options for AI creators.
